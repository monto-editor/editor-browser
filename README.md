Codemirror Monto
================

This is a web-based editor for Monto using CodeMirror.

Install instructions
--------------------

1. Get the [Monto broker](https://github.com/monto-editor/broker)
   and follow the build instructions
2. Get the [services] (https://github.com/monto-editor) of your choice
3. Run the broker using the `start.sh` script located in the broker project folder
4. Run the services using the `start.sh` script located in the service project folder
5. Run the websocket-zeromq proxy
6. Open `index.html` with a browser (tested with Chromium 44.0 and Firefox 40.0)
7. Click on `Options`, then `Discover`
8. Configure discovered services as wanted
9. Click on `Editor`
10. Select the language of your choice in the dropdown menu with the label `text`

The broker should be started before the services, because they have to register themselves at the broker.
It may also work the other way round but this is not guaranteed.
